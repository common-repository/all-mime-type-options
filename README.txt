== Description ==

Get access to all uploaded mime types via the media type filter in the media library.

Do you miss some of the file types in the 'All media' filter of the library? Do you wish to list only PDF files, ZIP files, JPEG files etc.? If yes, 'All Mime Type Options' is the plugin for that.

The plugin 'All Mime Type Options' **adds all uploaded file types to the 'All media' filter in the library** and everywhere where the 'post_mime_types' filter is triggered. The additional options are available in the **list mode** of the library (not yet in grid mode).

Both mime types supported by WordPress and mime types added by plugins are available in the media filter.

'All Mime Type Options' is very easy to use: install and activate the plugin and you are done! The media filter is extended with the uploaded file types automatically without any configuration.

The plugin is translated in many languages:

* Dutch (Nederlands)
* English
* French (Français)
* German (Deutsch)
* Italian (Italiano)
* Japanese (日本語), kindly drawn up by [Kazuyuki Kumai](https://wordpress.org/support/users/kazuyk/)
* Portuguese (Português)
* Spanish (Español)

Your translation will be very appreciated.

The plugin does not collect any personal data, so it is ready for EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.
